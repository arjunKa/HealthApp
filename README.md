# HealthApp

A C++ console app with a saving feature to allow user to store their
biometric data, calorie and fitness progress. The user data is then
used to form simple calculations and predictions for the user such
as their BMI and more complicated ones such as estimated calorie
intake to help in weight gain or weight loss. Json is used to save
and retrieve user data and resume progress such as their calorie
tracking across days. C++ is ideal for Json data retrieval and
permits control over the storage of the user data.
